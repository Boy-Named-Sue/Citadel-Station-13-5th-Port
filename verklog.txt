The ways a verk has been mangling these files.


4th fart, driders and blatant adminbus edition. (shame on you dirty enablers)
-Finished driders after so many months of hardly touching anything at all. Requires taur form same way the nagas do.
-Restored the race list alphabetical order.
-Bigass werenerd mob. Please try not to abuse her too much when I'm off. Not that I care, I just don't wanna miss a chance to bear witness if it ever happens lmao.
-Indulged too much with the werenerd development. We have a shitty object swallowing mechanic now. Easymode restricted to adminbus mob.
-Experimental Omnichompers can be researched now for prementioned ability. Requires nutpump level research and bananium. Attaches to mask slot and can be used as internals. Not self-removable. Nukedisc proofed.
-Nutpump haha.
-I forgot if I added anything else.

3rd whatever. OLD
-Added corvid race. Guaranteed to leave no mask unpunctured.
-Added 2 color layers for otter.
